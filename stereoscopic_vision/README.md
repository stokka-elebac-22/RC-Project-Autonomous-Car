## How It Works

1. Take photos with the take_photos.py script.
    NOTE: You need to take the photos with both cameras at the same time.
2. Calibrate the cameras using the calibrate.py script. The xml file will be stored in the data folder, but not pushed to git.
3. Run stereoscopic_vision.py
